# Problem Solving Reflection in Triangle-and-Incircle

This repository documents my approach to solving mathematical and logical problems.
Instead of only presenting answers, I reflect on my thinking process: first attempts, mistakes, insights, and lessons learned.
The goal is to develop clearer reasoning, better structure, and deeper intuition in problem solving.
The problem is basically a common geometry problem combining circles and triangles.
